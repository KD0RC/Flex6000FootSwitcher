# Flex6000FootSwitcher
Allows two footswitches to operate a Flex 6000 series radio.  One operates slice 0 and the other operates slice 1.
When a footswitch is pressed, the associated slice will become the TX slice and PTT will be activated.  Releasing 
the switch releases PTT and leaves the TX flag alone.
